Hey! Here's a guide to all the music disc's proper names. I tried to get the names to change but unfortunately was not able to do so. These are all in order, except for Mind Electric at the bottom of the HP2 songs, as I felt the broken Disc 11 texture fit the shattering of Simon's mind in the song.

cat - Isle Unto Thyself
blocks - Black Rainbows
chirp - White Ball
far - Murders
